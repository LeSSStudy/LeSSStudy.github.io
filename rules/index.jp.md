([what changed since previous version](rules-changes.html))
The LeSS Rules are the definition of the LeSS Framework. They are things we consider a must. Why? This is explained in the [Why LeSS?](../framework/why-less.html) section.

LeSSルールは、LeSSフレームワークの定義です。
これは必須のものです。
なぜ？は、[なぜLeSS?](../framework/why-less.jp.html)で説明します。

## LeSS Framework Rules

The LeSS framework applies to products with 2-“8” teams.

## LeSSフレームワークルール

### LeSS Structure

* Structure the organization using real teams as the basic organizational building block.
* Each team is (1) self-managing, (2) cross-functional, (3) co-located, and (4) long-lived.
* The majority of the teams are customer-focused feature teams.
* ScrumMasters are responsible for a well-working LeSS adoption. Their focus is towards the Teams, Product Owner, organization, and development practices. A ScrumMaster does not focus on just one team but on the overall organizational system.
* A ScrumMaster is a dedicated full-time role.
* One ScrumMaster can serve 1-3 teams.
* In LeSS, managers are optional, but if managers do exist their role is likely to change. Their focus shifts from managing the day-to-day product work to improving the value-delivering capability of the product development system.
* Managers’ role is to improve the product development system by practicing Go See, encouraging Stop & Fix, and “experiments over conformance”.
* For the product group, establish the complete LeSS structure “at the start”; this is vital for a LeSS adoption.
* For the larger organization beyond the product group, adopt LeSS evolutionarily using Go and See to create an organization where experimentation and improvement is the norm.

### LeSSの構造

* 基本的な組織の構成要素として実際のチームより構築する
* 各チームは、(1)自己組織化、(2)機能横断的、(3)同じ場所、(4)長命です。
* チームの大半は顧客重視のフィーチャーチーム
* スクラムマスターは、上手に働くためにLeSSを採用する責任がある。チーム、プロダクトオーナー、組織、開発プラクティスにフォーカスします。スクラムマスターは、一つだけのチームではなく、組織全体にフォーカスします。
* スクラムマスターは、フルタイムのロール
* 一人のスクラムマスターは、1~3チーム受け持つことができます。
* LeSSでは、マネージャーはオプションですが、マネージャーが存在する場合は、その役割は変化する。マネージャーの焦点は、日々の生産活動を管理することから、製品開発システムの価値を提供する能力の向上にシフトする
* 'マネージャー'の役割は、現場主義、Stop&Fixを奨励、"適合することよりも実験"を使って、製品開発システムを改善することです。
* プロダクトグループは、"開始時"にLeSSの構造を確立します。これはLeSSを採用するためには不可欠です。
* プロダクトグループを超えた大規模な組織の場合は、実験と改善が標準であるような組織を作成するために、現場主義を使用し、LeSSを進化的に採用する。

### LeSS Product

* There is one Product Owner and one Product Backlog for the complete shippable product.
* The Product Owner shouldn’t work alone on Product Backlog refinement; he is supported by the multiple Teams working directly with customers/users and other stakeholders.
* All prioritization goes through the Product Owner, but clarification is as much as possible directly between the Teams and customer/users and other stakeholders.
* One shared Definition of Done for the whole product.
* Each team can have their own expanded Definition of Done.
* The definition of product should be as broad and end-user/customer centric as is practical. Over time, the definition of product might increase. Broader definitions are preferred.
* The perfection goal is to improve the Definition of Done so that it results in a shippable product each Sprint (or even more frequently).

### LeSS Sprint

* There is one product-level Sprint, not a different Sprint for each Team. Each Team starts and ends the Sprint at the same time. Each Sprint results in an integrated whole product.
* Sprint Planning consists of two parts: Sprint Planning Part One is common for all teams while Sprint Planning Part Two is usually done separately for each team.
* Sprint Planning Part One is attended by the Product Owner and Teams or Team representatives. They together tentatively select the items that each team will work on the next Sprint. The Teams identify opportunities to work together and final questions are clarified.
* Each Team has their own Sprint Backlog.
* Sprint Planning Part Two is for Teams to decide how they will do the selected items. This usually involves design and the creation of their Sprint Backlogs. The Team forecasts how many items they believe they can complete during the next Sprint.
  * Guidance: For some Teams, do it in a shared space to enhance coordination.
* Each Team has their own Daily Scrum.
* Cross-team coordination is decided by the teams. Prefer decentralized and informal coordination over centralized coordination
  * Guidance: Coordination via Open Space, joining other teams’ Daily Scrum, Scrum of Scrums, multi-team workshops, or “simply” working in the same space, talking to each other, and using visual management.
* Product Backlog Refinement (PBR) is done per team for the items they are likely going to do in the future. Do multi-team PBR to increase shared understanding and exploting coordination opportunities when having closely related items or a need for broader input/learning
  * Guidance: Hold an overall PBR with representatives before each team PBR to explore which teams might work on which items, and to increase learning and alignment.
* There is one product Sprint Review; it is common for all teams. Ensure that enough stakeholders join to contribute the information needed for effective inspection and adaptation.
  * Guidance: Use decentralized “diverge-merge” techniques for better feedback and less boring meetings.
* Each Team has their own Sprint Retrospective.
* An Overall Retrospective is held after the Team Retrospectives to discuss cross-team and system-wide issues, and create improvement experiments. This is attended by Product Owner, ScrumMasters, Team Representatives, and managers (if there are any).

## LeSS Huge Framework Rules

LeSS Huge applies to products with “8+” teams. Avoid applying LeSS Huge for smaller product groups as it will result in more overhead and local optimizations.

All LeSS rules apply to LeSS Huge, unless otherwise stated.

### LeSS Huge Structure

* Customer requirements that are strongly related from a customer perspective are grouped in Requirement Areas.
* Each Team specializes in one Requirement Area. Teams are there “long term”; this won’t change each Sprint but Teams will change Requirement Area when others grow in value.
* Each Requirement Area has one Area Product Owner.
* Each Requirement Area has between “4-8” teams. Avoid violating this range.
* LeSS Huge adoptions, including the structural changes, are done with an evolutionary incremental approach.
* Remember each day: LeSS Huge adoptions take months or years, infinite patience, and sense of humor.

### LeSS Huge Product

* Each Requirement Area has one Area Product Owner.
* One (overall) Product Owner is responsible for product-wide prioritization and deciding which teams work in which Area. He works closely with Area Product Owners.
* Area Product Owners act as Product Owners towards their teams.
* There is one Product Backlog; every item in it belongs to exactly one Requirement Area.
* There is one Area Product Backlog per Requirement Area. This backlog is conceptually a more granular view onto the one Product Backlog.

### LeSS Huge Sprint

* There is one product-level Sprint, not a different Sprint for each Requirement Area. It ends in one integrated whole product.
* All Sprint LeSS rules apply for each Requirement Area.
* The Product Owner and Area Product Owners synchronize frequently. Before Sprint Planning they ensure the Teams work on the most valuable items. After the Sprint Review, they enable product-level adaptations.
* A Sprint Review is held per Requirement Area.
  * Guidance: Hold an additional product-level Sprint Review, to inspect key items, and to summarize and synchronize the learnings to enable product-level adaptation.
* A Overall Retrospective is held per Requirement Area.
  * Guidance: Hold an additional product-level Overall Retrospective to identify global problems and structural changes, and create improvement experiments.
