Scaling Scrum starts with understanding standard one-team Scrum. From that point, your organization must be able to understand and adopt LeSS, which requires examining the purpose of one-team Scrum elements and figuring out how to reach the same purpose while staying within the constraints of the standard Scrum rules.

Agile development with Scrum requires a deep organizational change to become agile. Therefore, neither Scrum nor LeSS should be considered as merely a practice. Rather, they form an organizational design framework.


## Two Agile Scaling Frameworks

LeSS provides two different large-scale Scrum frameworks. Most of the scaling elements of LeSS are focused on directing the attention of all of the teams onto the whole product instead of “my part.” Global and “end-to-end” focus are perhaps the dominant problems to solve in scaling. The two frameworks – which are basically single-team Scrum scaled up – are:

* LeSS: Up to eight teams (of eight people each).
* LeSS Huge: Up to a few thousand people on one product.

### What does it mean to be the same as One-Team Scrum?

LeSS is a scaled up version of one-team Scrum, and it maintains many of the practices and ideas of one-team Scrum. In LeSS, you will find:

* a single Product Backlog (because it’s for a product, not a team),
* one Definition of Done for all teams,
* one Potentially Shippable Product Increment at the end of each Sprint,
* one (overall) Product Owner,
* many complete, cross-functional teams (with no specialist teams),
* one Sprint.

In LeSS all Teams are in a common Sprint to deliver a common PSPI.

### What’s Different in LeSS?

* Sprint Planning Part 1 has the same maximum duration as in single-team Scrum, one hour per week of Sprint, but participation is limited to two members per team plus the one overall Product Owner. Let team representatives self-manage to decide their division of Product Backlog Items and end by identifying dependencies (perhaps with a dependency matrix) and discussing coordination.
* Sprint Planning Part 2 is held independently (and usually parallel) by each Team, though sometimes a member of Team A may observe Team B’s meeting and make suggestions when there is a coordination issue between the teams.
* Daily Scrum is also held independently by each Team, though a member of Team A may observe Team B’s Daily Scrum, to increase information sharing.
* Team representatives may hold an Open Space, Town Hall Meeting, or Scrum of Scrums several times a week to increase information sharing and coordination.
* The Overall Product Backlog Refinement meeting is attended by two representatives per team and concentrates on splitting, lightweight analysis (e.g., only three examples per item if using Specification by Example), and estimation for upcoming PBIs. Use cross-team estimation to ensure a common baseline for estimation across teams.
* Product Backlog Refinement: Similar to single-team Scrum, but for co-located teams, hold this at the same time in one big room with all team members present, with each team facing a separate wall with their own learning tools (whiteboards, projectors, ...).
* Sprint Review: Same as single-team Scrum but limited to two members per team plus the Product Owner and other stakeholders. Consider a “bazaar” or “science fair”-style phase during the middle of the Review: a large room with multiple areas, each staffed by team representatives, where the features developed by a team are shown and discussed. In parallel, stakeholders visit areas of interest and team members record their feedback. However, begin and end the Sprint Review with everyone in a common discussion to increase overall feedback and alignment.
* Overall Retrospective: Maximum duration: 45 minutes per week of Sprint. Since the Team Retrospective ends the Sprint, this Joint Retrospective is held early in the first week of the subsequent Sprint. ScrumMasters and one representative of each Team meet to identify and plan improvement experiments for the overall product or organization.
