<!---
Scaling Scrum starts with understanding standard one-team Scrum. From that point, your organization must be able to understand and adopt LeSS, which requires examining the purpose of one-team Scrum elements and figuring out how to reach the same purpose while staying within the constraints of the standard Scrum rules.
-->
<p>スケーリングスクラムは、標準的な1チームでのスクラムを理解することから始まります。
その時から、あなたの組織はLeSSを理解し、導入できるはずである。
それは、標準のスクラムの制約を維持しながら、1チームでのスクラムの要素の目的を調べ、同じ目的に到達する方法を理解する。
<!---
Agile development with Scrum requires a deep organizational change to become agile. Therefore, neither Scrum nor LeSS should be considered as merely a practice. Rather, they form an organizational design framework.
--->
アジャイル開発のスクラムは、アジャイルになるために、大幅な組織変更を必要とします。

## Two Agile Scaling Frameworks

<p>## 2つのスケーリングアジャイルフレームワーク</p>

<!---
LeSS provides two different large-scale Scrum frameworks. Most of the scaling elements of LeSS are focused on directing the attention of all of the teams onto the whole product instead of “my part.” Global and “end-to-end” focus are perhaps the dominant problems to solve in scaling. The two frameworks – which are basically single-team Scrum scaled up – are:

Lessのスケーリングの要素のほとんどは、”私のパート”の代わりに、プロダクト全体にチームの注意を向けることに焦点を当てている。
グローバルおよび”エンドツーエンド”の焦点は、おそらくスケーリングで解決できる主要な問題です。
2つのフレームワーク - 基本的に1チームのスクラムをスケールアップする - 以下のとおりです。</p>

### What’s Different in LeSS?
--->
### 何がLeSSで違うのか？
<!---
* Sprint Planning Part 1 has the same maximum duration as in single-team Scrum, one hour per week of Sprint, but participation is limited to two members per team plus the one overall Product Owner. Let team representatives self-manage to decide their division of Product Backlog Items and end by identifying dependencies (perhaps with a dependency matrix) and discussing coordination.

* スプリントプランニング第1部は、1チームでのスクラムと同様に、1週間のスプリントであれば1時間のタイムボックスで開催されるが、参加者は各チーム毎に2人のメンバーと1人の全体的なプロダクトオーナーに制限されます。
チームの代表者たちは、依存関係を特定し(おそらく依存関係のマトリックスで)、連携を議論することによって、プロダクトバックログアイテムの振り分けを自分たちで決定する</p>

<!---
* Sprint Planning Part 2 is held independently (and usually parallel) by each Team, though sometimes a member of Team A may observe Team B’s meeting and make suggestions when there is a coordination issue between the teams.
--->
<ul>
  <li>スプリントプランニング第2部は、それぞれのチームが独立して(通常は平行で)開催する。チーム間の連携に課題がある場合は、チームAのメンバーがチームBのミーティングを観察するかもしれない

&lt;!—</li>
  <li>The Overall Product Backlog Refinement meeting is attended by two representatives per team and concentrates on splitting, lightweight analysis (e.g., only three examples per item if using Specification by Example), and estimation for upcoming PBIs.

  <li>全体的なプロダクトバックログリファインメントは、チーム毎に2人の代表者が出席し、次回実施するであろうプロダクトバックログアイテムの分割に集中し、軽量な分析 (e.g., only three examples per item if using Specification by Example)を行い、見積る。チーム間で共通した見積りのベースラインを確保するために、クロスチームでの見積りを行う。
&lt;!—</li>
  <li>Product Backlog Refinement: Similar to single-team Scrum, but for co-located teams, hold this at the same time in one big room with all team members present, with each team facing a separate wall with their own learning tools (whiteboards, projectors, …).

&lt;!—</li>
  <li>Sprint Review: Same as single-team Scrum but limited to two members per team plus the Product Owner and other stakeholders. Consider a “bazaar” or “science fair”-style phase during the middle of the Review: a large room with multiple areas, each staffed by team representatives, where the features developed by a team are shown and discussed. In parallel, stakeholders visit areas of interest and team members record their feedback. However, begin and end the Sprint Review with everyone in a common discussion to increase overall feedback and alignment.
—&gt;</li>
  <li>スプリントレビュー:1つのチームでのスクラムと同じだが、各チーム毎に2名とプロダクトオーナーと外部のステークホルダーで実施する。レビューの途中で”バザール”や”サイエンスフェア”スタイルのフェーズを検討してみよう。複数のエリアがある大きな部屋で、エリアごとにチームの代表が、そこでチームによって開発されたフィーチャーを見せ、議論する。並行してステークホルダーは興味のあるエリアに訪れチームメンバーはフィードバックを記録する。しかしながら、最初と最後は、全体的なフィードバックと整合性を高めるために、全員で共通の議論を行う。
&lt;!—</li>
  <li>Overall Retrospective: Maximum duration: 45 minutes per week of Sprint. Since the Team Retrospective ends the Sprint, this Joint Retrospective is held early in the first week of the subsequent Sprint. ScrumMasters and one representative of each Team meet to identify and plan improvement experiments for the overall product or organization.
—&gt;</li>
  <li>全体的なふりかえり:1週間のスプリントであれば45分のタイムボックス。
チームのふりかえりはスプリントの最後に実施しているので、この共同でのふりかえりは、次のスプリントの最初の週の早い時期に開催される。

## One-Team Scrum

In a nutshell... Scrum is an empirical process control development framework in which a cross-functional self-managing team develops a product in an iterative incremental manner. At the end of each (on average) two-week *Sprint* a completely ‘done’ *potentially shippable product increment* (for short, *shippable increment*) is delivered, and possibly shipped. A single *Product Owner* is responsible for maximizing product value, prioritizing *items* (features) in the *Product Backlog*, and adaptively deciding the goal of each Sprint based on frequent inspection. A *Team* of about seven is responsible for delivering the Sprint goal, and they have or learn all required skills. There are no special job titles and no single-specialized sub-teams. A *ScrumMaster* educates about Scrum and how to derive value with it, and coaches the Product Owner, Team, and organization to apply it. There is no project manager, team lead, or other role in Scrum. A Sprint starts with *Sprint Planning*, and ends with a *Sprint Review* and *Sprint Retrospective* to inspect and adapt, respectively, about the product and processes.

*Empirical process control* requires transparency, which is created through short-cycle iterative development of shippable increments. It emphasizes continuous learning, inspection, and adaptation about both product and processes. It is based on recognizing that in product R&D things are too complex and dynamic for detailed, formulaic, and “one size fits all” organization and process recipes.

In the *Scrum Guide* and *Scrum Primer*, Scrum is described for one team.

## LeSS

Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS) is Scrum applied to many teams working together on one product. Why LeSS? Similar to one-team Scrum...

> For large groups, LeSS hits a sweet-spot balance between defined concrete elements and empirical process control.

And just like one-team Scrum, LeSS is (1) lightweight, (2) simple to understand, and (3) difficult to master—due to essential complexity.

### Background

In 2002, when Craig wrote *Agile & Iterative Development*, many ‘knew’ that agile development was for small groups. However, we became interested in—and got increasing requests—to apply Scrum to very large and multisite product development. So, since 2005 Craig and Bas have teamed up to work with clients to scale up Scrum. Today, the two LeSS frameworks (basic LeSS and LeSS Huge) have been adopted in big product groups worldwide in disparate domains, including:

* telecom-equipment creators such as Ericsson & Nokia Networks
* investment and retail banks such as JPMorgan and BAML
* trading-system creators such as ION Trading
* gaming site creators such as bwin
* offshore outsourcers such as Valtech India

To quantify ‘large’, as of this writing, at the top end we are involved in a LeSS Huge adoption in a product group of about 2500 people, 10 developments sites, tens of millions of lines of C++, with custom hardware.

What’s an industry-median LeSS product group size? Perhaps three to five teams in one or two sites.

Based on our experiences, in 2008 and 2010, we published two volumes on scaling agile development with the LeSS frameworks:

1. *Scaling Lean & Agile Development: Thinking and Organizational Tools for Large-Scale Scrum*, that explains the thinking, leadership, and organizational design changes.
2. *Practices for Scaling Lean & Agile Development: Large, Multisite & Offshore Product Development with Large-Scale Scrum*, that explains concrete advice for scaling Scrum, including in product management, architecture, planning, multisite, offshore, and contracts.

This is the third book in the LeSS series, a prequel and primer. It summarizes rather than replaces the others. If you want, um… more LeSS details, read the first two volumes or the website less.works.

### LeSS Principles and Themes

<figure>
  <img src="/img/principles.png" alt="principles.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 2.1 LeSS principles</figcaption>
</figure>

**Large-Scale Scrum is Scrum**—It is not “new and improved Scrum.” Rather, LeSS is about figuring out how to apply the principles, elements, and purpose of Scrum in a large-scale context.

**Empirical process control**—Inspection and adaptation of the product, processes, organizational design, and practices to craft a situational appropriate organization based on Scrum, rather than following a detailed formula. And empirical process control requires and creates…

**Transparency**—Based on tangible ‘done’ items, short cycles, working together, common definitions, and driving out fear in the workplace.

**More with less**—(1) In empirical process control: more learning with less defined processes. (2) In lean thinking: more value with less waste and overhead. (3) In scaling, less roles, artifacts, and special groups.

**Whole-product focus**—One Product Backlog, one Product Owner, one potentially shippable product increment, one Sprint—regardless if there are 3 or 33 teams. Customers want the product, not a part.

**Customer-centric**—Identify value and waste in the eyes of the paying customer. Reduce the cycle time from their perspective. Increase feedback loops with real customers. Everyone understands how their work today directly relates to and benefits paying customers.

**Continuous improvement towards perfection**—Create and deliver a product all the time, with no cost and no defects, that utterly delights customers, improves the environment, and makes lives better. Do humble and radical improvement experiments each Sprint towards that.

**Systems thinking**—See, understand, and optimize the whole system (not parts), and use causal-loop modeling to explore system dynamics. Avoid the local and sub-optimizations of focusing on the ‘efficiency’ or ‘productivity’ of individuals and individual teams. Customers care about the overall concept-to-cash cycle time and flow, not individual steps.

**Lean thinking**—Create an organizational system whose foundation is managers-as-teachers who apply and teach systems thinking and lean thinking, manage to improve, and who practice Go See at gemba. Add the two pillars of respect for people and continuous improvement. All towards the goal of perfection.

**Queuing theory**—Understand how systems with queues behave in the R&D domain, and apply those insights to managing queue sizes, work-in-progress limits, multitasking, work packages, and variability.

### Two Frameworks: LeSS & LeSS Huge

Large-Scale Scrum has two frameworks:

* **LeSS**: 2–‘8’ Teams.
* **LeSS Huge**: ‘8+’ Teams, up to a few thousand people per product.

The word ‘LeSS’ is overloaded to mean both Large-Scale Scrum in general, and the smaller basic LeSS framework. We find this convenient.

**LeSS Framework**—The (basic) LeSS framework is for one overall Product Owner (PO) and two to ‘eight’ teams. There is one overall real **Product** Owner (who truly “owns the product”) for one real shippable product, who manages one Product Backlog worked on by all the teams in one Sprint, optimizing for the whole product.

‘Eight’ is not a magic number for choosing between LeSS and LeSS Huge. The tipping point is situational. At some point, (1) the single overall PO can no longer grasp an overview of the entire product, (2) the PO cannot balance an external and internal focus, and (3) the Product Backlog is so large that it becomes difficult for one person to work with.

When the group *tips*, time to change. Perhaps to LeSS Huge, but try first to get smaller and simpler, not *huger*.

The remainder of this major section explains the smaller **LeSS framework**; the **LeSS Huge framework** is covered later.

### LeSS Framework Elements

The (smaller) LeSS framework elements are essentially the same as one-team Scrum:

**Roles**—one overall Product Owner, two to ‘eight’ Teams, ScrumMasters.

**Artifacts**—There is one potentially shippable product increment, one Product Backlog, and a separate Sprint Backlog for each Team.

**Events**—There is one Sprint for the whole product; it includes all teams and ends in one potentially shippable product increment. Event details are explained in the upcoming LeSS *stories*, and in separate chapters.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/framework/less-framework.png" alt="less-framework.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 2.2 LeSS framework</figcaption>
</figure>

In addition to these elements, LeSS includes:

**Rules**—Things the group should follow and do, such as Sprint Planning One and Two, and one Product Backlog for the shippable product. There are LeSS rules related to roles, artifacts, and events.

The few simple LeSS rules balance the low ‘prescriptive-ness’ required for empirical process control and the need especially for new adopters for some specific direction to know *what and how* when starting. And then be able to truly create transparency with LeSS. “More specific when starting” reflects the *introductory*-level learning needs recognized in several learning models. The jazz trumpeter and teacher Clark Terry neatly summed up the learning progression: Imitate, Assimilate, Innovate. Some know this as *Shu-Ha-Ri* (follow, detach, transcend) in Akido.

**Guides**—Advice to try, based on the experience of LeSS adopters, such as how to coordinate across teams during the Sprint. May or may not be appropriate, and are areas for continuous improvement experiments.

How to grasp the LeSS elements in practice? We’ll tell some stories...

### LeSS Story: Flow of Teams & Events

> This story emphasizes the flow of *people and teams* going through events in a LeSS Sprint. A later story emphasizes the flow of customer features through events.

On a crisp and sunny London morning, Dave walks into the distinctive ‘Gherkin’ building in the financial heart of The City. He takes the lift up to the 17th floor, and heads into the room where his team works—Team Trade, who collectively know quite a lot about trading European bonds. Devi’s already there, but not the rest of the crew. “Good morning!” she greets Dave. “Just a reminder: We’re the team representatives this Sprint and Sprint Planning One starts in 10 minutes.” “Right,” says Dave, “I’m gonna grab an espresso and meet you in the big room.”

#### Sprint Planning One

A few minutes later Dave settles down into a chair in the big room. Devi and a few other developers came in right behind Dave, and now there’s quorum—there’s 10 team representatives from the five teams who work on their flagship product for trading bonds and managing position risk. Sam, the ScrumMaster of teams Trade and Margin, is already there. He’s planning to observe, and coach as needed. The group is starting their 4th two-week Sprint using LeSS, and it’s time for a common timeboxed two-hour Sprint Planning One.

Paolo walks in and says “Hi!” to the group. He’s the Product Owner and also the lead Product Manager. Two other Product Managers are already sitting at a table. Paolo lays out 22 ordered cards on a table, and says, “Here’s my offer for this Sprint. In addition to many Brazilian market features, some of the items are for new auditor reports for USA bond derivatives.”

<figure>
  <img src="/img/framework/sprint-planning-one-sketch.jpg" alt="sprint-planning-one-sketch.jpg">
</figure>

Sam reminds the group, “Don’t let all the highest-priority items be taken by one team. Try to distribute them across most of the teams.”

Dave and Devi walk over to the table (along with the other representatives) and they pick two cards for items related to European bonds that their team did the detailed Product Backlog refinement on over the last few Sprints. They pick a third item related to general order management that most of the teams understand quite well. A minute later, Dakota from Team Margin, on scanning Team Trade’s cards, asks Dave and Devi, “Can we do your order management feature? We did something similar last Sprint. We can swap with you for this new very straightforward report we picked up.” They agree.

After about five minutes, all the team representatives have chosen a total of 18 cards, leaving 4 relatively low-priority ones on the table. Paolo looks them over, picks one up, and says, “This one here is pretty important to me this Sprint. Let’s find a way to swap it with one of the items you’ve already chosen.”

After that’s resolved, it’s time for each team to craft a Sprint Goal and to clear up remaining questions—there’s always questions, even though these items were clarified in Product Backlog refinement in prior Sprints. In parallel, Dave, Devi, and the others write questions for their chosen items on flip-chart papers. Paolo and the two other Product Managers split up and visit different people, answering questions. After about 45 minutes, all lingering questions have been answered that could be answered.

Then Sam announces, “A reminder: The last thing we need to talk about together is *coordination.*” Don from Team Margin points out that one of the European bond items involves shared work with two items from Team Margin. Dave suggests, “Let’s hold our SP-two meetings together,” and Don agrees.

#### Sprint Planning Two

After a break, each team holds their own Sprint Planning Two, which is most often identical as in one-Team Scrum. But in this story...

Teams Trade and Margin hold a multi-team Sprint Planning Two: their individual meetings together in the big room, working at separate tables. They discover large design questions about their related items. Some of these questions they quickly answer with discussion and sketching on a whiteboard, but a few complex ones are deferred. For those, they agree to hold a *multi-team* Design Workshop after Sprint Planning. The teams recognize that may change some planning assumptions.

Shortly after Sprint Planning, a representative from each team updates the one common Product Backlog (a Google spreadsheet) with their team’s forecast of items they will do for the Sprint.

#### Multiteam Design Workshop

After another break, Dave and Devi from Team Trade, and a few people from Team Margin hold a timeboxed one-hour multi-team Design Workshop. Around a large whiteboard they do agile modeling until they have some clarity and agreement on a common design approach and shared technical work. Fortunately, the conclusions don’t seriously impact their existing Sprint plans, but they feel uncomfortable with their process, recognizing they could have predicted needing to resolve these big design questions earlier.

#### Overall Retrospective

On the second day of the Sprint, Sam and the other ScrumMasters, the Product Owner Paolo, a site manager named Mary, and one representative from each of the other teams, all get together for a 90-minute overall Retrospective related to the last Sprint. (They couldn’t hold an overall Retrospective at the end of the Sprint, because it finished with the regular team-level Retrospectives.) They focus on a system-wide issue and improvement: how to coordinate, share information, and solve problems across the entire group during the Sprint? Previously they have tried Scrum-of-Scrum meetings and didn’t find them very effective. Sam explains the technique of Open Space, and they agree to try that this Sprint.

#### Day 4 Coordination (coordinating in an example LeSS day)

In LeSS, each Team holds a Daily Scrum as usual. But to support coordination between Teams Trade and Margin, Devi joins Team Margin’s Daily Scrum. Conversely, Don joins Team Trade’s.

As agreed in the overall Retrospective, Dave and Devi join a group-wide 45-minute *Open Space* meeting for Sprint coordination with the team representatives. Sam acts as facilitator to teach the group.

Don is this year’s coordinator for the Test community of practice (CoP). He gets together for a half hour with a representative from each team so they can hear Dakota’s proposal related to their automated acceptance testing tool. It’s enthusiastically agreed, and Dakota volunteers her feature team to do the actual work next Sprint.

Dave is a member of the Architecture CoP. There’s no meeting this Sprint, but he wants to hold a half-day spike in the next Sprint for exploratory group programming with a new technology. He posts his idea to other members on their CoP collaboration tool.

The build and continuous integration (CI) system seems to have a weird bug. This Sprint Team Trade is responsible for it, and it’s one of Devi’s secondary specialties so she volunteers to fix it and asks Dave to pair up with her to help him learn more about it.

Later, Devi heads over to one of the Product Managers and asks if she’s free for a few minutes to look at the first item the team has finished. The Product Manager is free, so they play with it, and Devi leaves with a few minor improvements for the team to do.

Late in the day Dave is coding the second item, with the rest of Team Trade. He checks in a stable micro-change to the head of the trunk after each 10-minute TDD cycle, to integrate continuously with his team and product group. He glances over to their big visible red-green screen and sees that the CI system is passing all the tests for the entire group.

#### Overall PBR

On the fifth day, Dave and Devi join a group-wide *overall Product Backlog refinement (PBR)* workshop, with representatives from each team, the Product Owner, and the two other Product Managers. The group splits some big items, does some lightweight analysis, and estimates.

#### Team PBR

On the sixth day, Team Trade holds their team PBR workshop, which all team members attend together. Sometimes each team will hold their team PBR separately, but in this story...

From the recent Overall PBR session, Dave and Devi know that the theme of their team-level PBR session is new USA regulatory requirements, and also that two other teams frequently work in this area. Therefore, the three teams decide to hold a *multi-team* PBR workshop in the same big room, with two Product Managers and a lawyer from the Legal Department who has met recently with the regulators. The teams do rotation analysis, and some other diverge-merge workshop patterns.

#### Sprint Review

Finally, it’s the last day and time for a two-hour *Sprint Review*! There is just one overall product-level Review together. Because there are five teams and many items to inspect...

The group starts with a ‘diverging’ one-hour bazaar-style Review, with many laptops set up in the room, each showing different sets of items. The Product Owner, other Product Managers, and few sales people are inspecting different items in parallel. Some team members stay by their laptops to collect feedback, and others visit items that interest them.

After an hour, the group ‘merge’ into the second phase of the Review. First, using a laptop and projector, Paolo shows the Product Backlog spreadsheet, and marks which of the originally forecast items met ‘done’. Then he summarizes feedback about the items he was closely inspecting, and asks the other Product Managers and sales people to do likewise. Paolo displays and discusses 3 critical items with the entire group. Next, he confirms he wants to actually release the product now, to a subset of traders in a beta-test program. Finally, Paolo explains his probable direction for the next Sprint.

#### Team Retrospectives

After a break, Team Trade hold their team-level *Sprint Retrospective*. They decide that holding a multi-team Design Workshop after Sprint Planning (rather than before) was not very good. In the next Sprint they decide to hold an early Design Workshop for some strongly-related complex items, so that the teams can speculate about a common design, and identify likely shared-work opportunities. In the next overall Retrospective, they will suggest to identify and discuss strongly-related items during PBR.

#### The End

The Sprint is over. Sam invites the entire team to join Dave and him at the Belgian-beer pub down the street to celebrate Dave’s birthday.

### LeSS Story: Flow of Features & Events

> This story emphasizes the flow of *customer features* through events, versus the prior *people & teams* story.

Ariel is so looking forward to settling in for a luxurious business-class flight on Virgin Atlantic back to London, after this meeting wraps up. She beams her 1000-watt smile to the USA financial regulator, shakes hands, and catches a taxi to JFK.

After the weekend, she’s sitting with Paolo (the Product Owner and lead Product Manager) in his office, and admires the view from the Gherkin out over London. Ariel, a product manager who specializes in regulatory requirements, summarizes on some paper cards the new rule areas that are going to impact their product, and what existing clients she thinks are going to want certain requirements first. Paolo points to the five cards, and asks, “So this covers all the work, right?” Ariel smiles and says, “This is regulatory, Paolo. It’s never finished or clear.” Paolo asks, “Can you put these in the Product Backlog for me, unordered at the bottom for now?” “Sure.”

</figure>

A week later Paolo tells Ariel, “Soon, I want to start delivering one of the regulatory areas, for bond derivatives. In the next Sprint’s PBR workshops, I’m going to ask the teams to focus on refining those requirements. You’re the expert, so please be at overall PBR, and at whatever team PBRs they want you. That will be the 24th and 25th this month. Also, set up a wiki page with links to the new reg docs, to share with the teams.” “Sure,” says Ariel, “…and the page is already set up.”

#### Overall PBR

On the 24th Ariel walks into the big room for a half-day overall PBR workshop. Paolo is already there, along with Peter (the other product manager), and 10 team members from the five teams. Paolo kicks off, “We’ve got a large body of work around USA reg and derivs. In a couple of Sprints I want to start delivering the features because of a regulatory deadline end of fiscal year. We’ll know better after some refinement and estimation, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it involves three or more of the teams for implementation.”

The group organizes into a semi-circle of chairs around a big whiteboard, with Ariel at the board. On the left side she writes “regs for bond derivatives.” Then, in conversation with the group, she sketches a branching tree of smaller requirements, splitting, explaining, and answering questions. After 30 minutes, the original requirement has split into 16 smaller children items.

After a break, the group creates 16 cards for the new items. They pick seven of the items that Paolo and Ariel think are especially critical but also unclear (some of the requirements are clear and straightforward reports for auditors).

Using the specification-by-example technique that Sam (a ScrumMaster) taught them, the group discusses and creates one example for each of the seven critical but unclear items. After an hour and a half, the group has their examples and better shared understanding.

Following another short break, all the team members together speed-estimate the 16 new items, using planning poker and relative-size points, base-lining the points against some of the existing estimated items in the Product Backlog.

About half of the items are estimated as doable in one-third of a Sprint or less, by a team. That’s the group’s guideline for maximum size. The rest are bigger, and will need further splitting in a later PBR workshop.

Paolo looks over all 16 cards and with Ariel they remove some that are relatively low priority. Pointing to the remaining items Paolo says, “I’m gonna want those soon. Please focus on getting them ready.”

At the end of the workshop, the team members look over the items and decide that three of the five teams should focus on them: two teams that have previously worked USA bonds, and Team Trade, since upcoming European regulations are expected to be similar.

#### Multiteam PBR and Team PBR

The next day, Team Trade and the two USA teams (TooBigToFail and NotDerivative) hold full-day Team PBR workshops. They have 12 regulatory items to get ready as soon as possible. Since so many of them are related, they decide to hold a multi-team PBR workshop together in the big room. Product Managers Ariel and Peter join, but not Paolo.

The group does *rotation* work to refine the items: Each team starts refining a different item at a separate work area in the room, each with a whiteboard and projector. Ariel is with Team Trade and they start refining a regulatory report. Peter is with Team TooBigToFail, clarifying a position risk requirement. Team NotDerivative works alone.

After 30 minutes, a timer goes *ding*! Team Trade walks over to the TooBigToFail area, Team TooBigToFail walks over to NotDerivative’s area, and Team NotDerivative heads for Team Trade’s area. Ariel and Peter don’t move, and one of Team NotDerivative’s members also stays behind to explain things to the incoming team. The timer is restarted, the stay-behind people explain the current results, and then the teams carry on with refinement.

Throughout the day, as different regulatory requirements become clear—or are left with hanging questions that will have be explored later—new ones are introduced at a work area. Some of the bigger items are split into two or three new smaller ones.

Twice during the day the teams stop their analysis work, and do some estimation, which they do separately and in parallel for different items, once again all base-lining against some of items and estimates already in the Product Backlog.

#### The Next Day

The morning after the PBR workshop, Peter (who often helps Paolo with this):

* updates the Product Backlog with the new split items derived from the original one, and deletes the original
* adds links to the new wiki page of item details, created yesterday in the PBR workshop
* records the latest estimates, and records which of the items are deemed ready by the teams

Later in the day, Ariel and Peter meet with Paolo to review the Product Backlog changes, answer Paolo’s questions, and do reordering.

Paolo highlights the new and ready items for regulator audit reports and moves them near the top of the ordering; he decides he wants to get them done next Sprint because quickly getting reports to the auditors takes a lot of pressure off. A couple of items he now realizes are much less important than he and Ariel thought, and he moves them quite low—it could be months before he returns to them.

#### Sprint Planning One

Paolo lays out 22 ordered cards on a table, and says, “Here’s my offer for this Sprint. In addition to many Brazilian market features, some of the items are for new auditor reports for USA bond derivatives.”

## LeSS Huge

### Requirement Areas

With 1000 or even just 100 people on one product, divide-and-conquer is unavoidable. Traditional large-scale development divides into:

* single-function groups (analysis group, test group, ...)
* architectural-component groups (UI-layer group, server-side group, data-access component group, ...)

This organization yields slow inflexible development with (1) high levels of waste (inventory, work-in-progress, handoff, information scatter, ...), (2) long-delayed ROI, (3) complex planning and coordination, (4) more overhead management, and (5) weak feedback and learning. And it is organized ‘inward’ around single-skills and architecture, rather than ‘outward’ around customer value.

But in the **LeSS Huge** framework, when above ‘8’ teams, you don’t divide by function or architecture; you divide around *major areas of customer concerns* called **requirement areas**. This reflects the *customer-centric* LeSS principle.

For example, in one *Securities* product (to trade and manage securities), some major areas of customer requirements—requirement areas—are:

* trade processing (from trade capture to settlement)
* asset servicing (e.g. handling a stock split, dividends)
* new market onboarding (e.g. Brazil)

Conceptually in the one Product Backlog, a “requirement area” attribute is added, and each item is classified into one and only one area:

| Order    | Item   | Requirement Area      | ...  |
|:---------------------:|:------------------------:|
| 1        | B      | market onboarding     |      |
| 2        | C      | trade processing      |      |
| 3        | D      | asset servicing       |      |
| 4        | F      | market onboarding     |      |
| ...      |
{: .grid_table_with_header}

Then people can focus on one **Area Product Backlog** (conceptually, a view onto one Product Backlog), such as the *market onboarding* area:

| Order    | Item   | Requirement Area      | ...  |
|:---------------------:|:------------------------:|
| 1        | B      | market onboarding     |      |
| 4        | F      | market onboarding     |      |
{: .grid_table_with_header}

### Area Product Owners and Teams

In LeSS Huge one new role is introduced. Each requirement area has an **Area Product Owner** that specializes in one requirement area and focuses on their Area Product Backlog. And, *several*—never just one—feature teams serve that Area Product Owner and likewise specialize in that requirement area.

So, for example, the *Securities* product has:

* one overall Product Owner and two (one per area) Area Product Owners, each supported by other Product Managers
* the (largest) *trade processing* requirement area has six teams
* and four teams in each other requirement area

Does a requirement area always have the same fixed set of teams? No. Slowly over time, as an area changes in importance, teams join or depart—mostly likely from or to another existing area.

### LeSS Huge Framework Elements

In brief, in LeSS Huge each requirement area works as a (smaller framework) LeSS implementation, each working in parallel in one overall Sprint. Variations reflecting transitional periods in gigantic groups are discussed in the *Adoption and Organize by Customer Value* chapters.

**Roles**—Same as LeSS, except: two or more **Area Product Owners**, and ‘four’ to ‘eight’ Teams in *each requirement area*. The *one* Product Owner (who focuses on overall product optimization) and the several Area Product Owners form the **Product Owner Team**. There are usually other supporting product managers in very large product groups.

A requirement area normally has at least four teams. Exceptions?

* An early transitional situation when the group is incrementally growing a new area that is fully expected to ultimate have four or more teams. Then, start small and simple with one team.
* When re-balancing teams from an area with a decreasing demand to one with an increasing demand; an area could go from four to three teams. Ultimately, merge two reduced small areas back into a new larger area.

Why at least ‘four’ teams? What’s the problem with small areas? Many tiny areas reduce visibility into overall Product Backlog priorities, increase coordination complexity, and create teams that are too narrowly specialized that lack the flexibility (agility) to take on the emerging highest-value items.

**Artifacts**—Same as LeSS, except: a requirement area column in the one Product Backlog, and consequently an **Area Product Backlog** view for each requirement area.

**Events**—There is still only one common Sprint for the product; it includes all the teams and ends in a common potentially shippable product increment. From the viewpoint of one team working in one area, LeSS Huge looks like LeSS regarding events. Other event details are illustrated in the upcoming story.

As with LeSS, there are **rules** and **guides** for LeSS Huge, which are introduced in the following story, and fleshed out in upcoming chapters.

### LeSS Huge Story

Peter hears a new voice in the hallway, and bounds out of his office to warmly welcome Ariel to her new job. As a mid-level Operations manager in the *Securities* division of the large trading company, and overall Product Owner for their internal Securities system, he’s also responsible for finding and retaining talent for his Product Owner Team. And he thinks Ariel is a fantastic find as her expertise is exactly what is required for dealing with some new huge requirements.

During the recent job interview—when Ariel was a product manager specializing in regulatory issues at a company that made a system for trading bonds—Peter had laid out the situation. “Ariel, after the last crash, the regulators are coming down hard and they require us to be compliant with Dodd-Frank. Right now, we don’t know what it exactly means or how it will impact our system. You got incredible knowledge of this space, and a great professional network with the regulators. I would love it if you would join our group and help us figure out how to deal with this.”

#### A Big Surprise

A few days later...

Peter welcomes Ariel, Rob, and Krishna into his office. Rob is Area Product Owner for market onboarding, and Krishna is a ScrumMaster from the trade processing area.

Peter says, “As you know, Dodd-Frank is coming, and it’s huge. What you don’t know is that this morning the regulators called us and they want us to take action now. I’d been working under the assumption we could start next year. So we’re going to have to adapt, big time.”

“I don’t think anyone is clear what it means in detail—even the regulators. And we don’t know how it will impact our system and how much work this is going to take, other than, a lot! But now Ariel’s joined us and she has a better understanding of this than anyone, although she’s totally new to our systems. So, how can we help her start tackling this mountain of work?”

Rob, Krishna and Peter discuss different approaches. Rob asks, “You guys know about the Dyslexic Zombies, right?” Krishna and Peter nod. Everyone knows about them—and it isn’t just their name. The Dyslexic Zombies have probably the broadest experience of all the teams. They’ve been around for years and they were a true pain in the ass when they adopted LeSS. The team contained two former members of their now-abandoned architecture group and a couple of people who had been working on the system for over fifteen years. Those four’s resistance to the LeSS adoption was legendary as they were afraid they’d lose their “system perspective.” To their surprise, the opposite happened! Because of their deep knowledge they continuously get tough items to develop, they regularly participate as expert-teachers in current-architecture-learning workshops with newcomers, and Tom—one of the former PowerPoint architects—is now leading the architecture CoP. When fed enough beer, he’ll admit that working closer with code and tests has actually increased his real understanding of the system.

Rob continues, “If any team can quickly help Ariel get a better understanding of the size and impact of Dodd-Frank, it’ll be the Zombies. And they led the work on Sarbanes-Oxley a few years ago. Tomorrow is their refinement meeting. They are just about wrapped up on a new feature. Why don’t we re-direct the meeting to include them in a discussion on Dodd-Frank, and soon after, get them to focus full-time on it? Ariel, are you available?”

Ariel nods and they agree to meet the next day with the Zombies.

  <img src="/img/framework/zombies.png" alt="zombies.png">
</figure>

#### Refining with Zombies

Next day at the refinement meeting with the Zombies, Ariel explains the situation, “You’ve probably all heard about Dodd-Frank. But here’s the surprise: We’ve just been told by the regulators that they want to us to take action ‘now’ and demonstrate significant compliance by the end of the year. Otherwise they might restrict our trading.”

The Zombies are visibly surprised. They had heard rumors but didn’t expected such a rush! Tom says, “OK Ariel, give us a quick summary of what this means. And how is it different from Sarbanes-Oxley?”

Ariel picks up a pen and starts sketching on a whiteboard. After about 45 minutes, she is finished with the overview and the Zombies looked a little stunned. “End of the year, they said?” says Tom. “If the whole group started today, it wouldn’t get finished. This is huge!”

<figure>
  <img src="/img/framework/sharing-sketch.jpg" alt="sharing-sketch.jpg">
</figure>

He takes a pen and at the whiteboard starts a rough sketch of their system, talking with the other Zombies about the impact it might have. He says, “Ariel, let’s also use this as a chance to help you understand the system better. Ask away.” Ariel says, “Can you hold on for a sec? Let me start a video recording to help me remember this.”

Simon, a grizzled veteran in the team, says, “We’d better start on some real development soon and learn more as we go because otherwise we’ll end up analyzing forever. I’ve seen this story before.”

Alexandru, their ScrumMaster, says, “Reminds me… Tom DeMarco once said that the reason for every failed project is that it started too late.” Everyone laughs. He continues, “Good, let’s spend the rest of the session to find one clear area and ‘take a bite’ out of Dodd-Frank. We’ll put the big and smaller parts into our Area Product Backlog.”

Later, Ariel tells Peter what they did in the refinement meeting and their recommendation for where to start. She knows that Peter and the rest of the Product Owner Team will decide the next step.

#### Creating a New Requirement Area

The next day, Ariel, Peter, and rest of the Product Owner Team meet. Ariel shares a summary of the scope as she understands it now. Peter sighs and says, “This is even bigger than I expected. And the regulators have the power to shut us down now. I don’t think i need to explain the business case for keeping them happy enough so we can keep trading.”

“OK!” he says suddenly and decisively. “We’ll need a new area for this. Ariel, I know you are new to us, but do you think you would be able to handle the Area Product Owner responsibility for this?” Ariel nods.

Peter continues, “Rob do you think the Zombies could work on this? And we’ll need them to learn more Dodd-Frank and figure out the impact on our system before we can add more teams to this.” Rob says, “I don’t think we’ve got any choice.”

Peter says, “OK Ariel, so now we’ve got a few items in Rob’s Area Backlog, the one huge item I think you called “remainder of Dodd-Frank” and the smaller items which the team and you split off of it. I want you to get Rob to show you how to set up a new area in the Product Backlog and move the items over to it.” Ariel smiles and says, “Alexandru from the Zombies calls the smaller ones our first bite.”

Peter smiles back and says, “The next Sprint is in three days. Let’s move the Zombies into your area and get started on this monster. Probably in a couple of Sprints we’ll move another team to your new area. Ladies and gentlemen, everyone please think about which team would be suitable? Now, let’s end this meeting and do something!”

#### Sprint Planning in the New Requirement Area

Each of the requirement areas holds their own Sprint Planning meetings, all more or less in parallel. In Ariel’s new area, she starts her Sprint Planning by introducing two unfamiliar faces to the Zombies. She says, “Gillian and Zak have been in contact with the regulators regularly and will help us flesh this thing out. They’ve agreed to help us now in Planning, during our PBR sessions, and as much as they can spare daily during upcoming Sprints.”

She continues, “Here’s my plan of attack for the next two Sprints. First, together we need to learn more about Dodd-Frank, and also split it into some major and manageable pieces so we can start to clear the fog and get a better sense of priorities.”

“Second, we’re going to implement the smaller bite we’ve already taken, starting this Sprint. That’ll give us better information about the real work. And we’ll have some concrete visible progress.”

“Third, we’re going to prepare for more teams to join our area.”

Tom takes over from Ariel and shares with his team, “Let me explain that, cuz I represented our team in the POT meeting. To start with, it’s just us. We’re gonna take the lead on early implementation, and getting the big picture of the item, and understanding the overall impact on our architecture.”

Simon interrupts, “Like a tiger team working on a new product?” “Yes, like that,” says Tom. “Think of Dodd-Frank support as a new product that needs to be integrated into the rest of the product. But we’re in a hurry, so in a few Sprints another team will join us and shortly after, probably two more teams. We keep developing too, but we’ll be the leading team which means we’ll need to bring the other teams up to speed and make sure we keep the overall product in mind.”

Simon says, “It’s starting to sound to me like we’re gonna become the architecture and project management team.” Tom laughs, “No. I’m done with that. We’re still a normal team, but besides development we focus on mentoring and teaching the new teams and keep an eye on the overall system integrity. But let’s be clear: team coordination and management is still the responsibility of each team.”

#### The First Sprint in the New Requirement Area

The first Sprint is unusual in that they spend almost half of their time in refinement together with Gillian and Zak, and only half in developing.

But the discussion and the learning from coding pays off. Slowly but surely they start to split Dodd-Frank apart—at least the parts that any of them can understand. It seems no one knows all that it means.

While implementing the small item they had bitten off first, much of the time is together at whiteboards to discuss the overall design implications on the system. They move frequently back and forth between the code and the wall.

#### Sprint Review in the New Requirement Area

The overall Securities product group works together in one Sprint, with one final shippable product increment. But each of the requirement areas holds their own Sprint Review, all more or less in parallel.

In Ariel’s area, during their Review, she inspects and uses the one ‘done’ item that the Zombies have managed to complete and integrate into the overall product. They had original forecast two items, but Ariel is impressed that they even got one done, given how fast this new work was thrown at them.

#### The Second Sprint

In the second Sprint they’re able to make slightly better progress on items, though they once again spend almost half of their time in refinement together with Gillian and Zak.

In the middle of the Sprint they hold a multi-team PBR session with the second team that is soon planned to join the area, teaching them about Dodd-Frank. And they hold a multi-team Design Workshop to start to introduce the incoming team to what they’ve changed so far, and their speculation for the upcoming items.

The Zombies know how big the work is and very much look forward to getting more help.

#### Product Owner Team Meeting

A few Sprints later...

It’s time once more for the per-Sprint Product Owner Team meeting. They use it to align and coordinate between the different Area Product Owners, and for Peter to provide overall guidance.

The Area Product Owners each share in turn their situation and upcoming goals. When it’s her turn, Ariel says, “To none of our surprise, the progress is little and the surprises are big. But the velocity is starting to pick up as the fog clears and the teams and I are getting our heads around the work. Gillian and Zak have been tremendous.”

Ravi, the asset servicing Area Product Owner, comments on some close item relationships he now sees between their areas. Ariel makes a note in the item’s wiki page, and agrees to meet with Ravi and some team representatives later.

Peter says, “Ariel, about our upcoming Sprint. What’s your goals?” …

####  Adding a Third Team

A few Sprints later...

At the Product Owner Team coordination meeting, Peter says, “As you know, Ariel’s area still only has two teams. I know that Ravi would like to keep his four teams in asset servicing, but Dodd-Frank is just too important to me this year. So we’re going to move one team from Ravi’s area into Ariel’s. Ravi, please ask for a volunteer team from your group and let me and Ariel know.”

## Multisite

### Dispersed versus Multisite Teams

If the entire tiny development group is eight people in three countries, there is a single *dispersed* ‘team’. (We don’t recommend that; we’re defining terms.) But when your single product group is 50 or 500 people, dispersed teams are not necessary; each team can easily be co-located literally at the same table. However, some teams may be in different sites, so that the product group has *multisite teams*.

### LeSS Huge Story when Multisite

Ariel is the Area Product Owner for a new requirement area in a Securities trading system. The new area started with just one team, for focus and simplicity. But Peter, the overall Product Owner, predicted from the start that it would eventually need at least four teams, given how big the work was. After a few Sprints, a second team was added; the original team, the Dyslexic Zombies, acted as mentors for the second.

A few Sprints later, Ariel’s area gets a third team. But unlike her first two teams that are based in London with her, her third new team, *HouseDraculesti*, is based in Cluj Romania, at a major development site for the company.

Peter knows that multisite teams are a new situation for Ariel, and he invites her to a meeting. He says, “Hi Ariel. I wanted to share some multisite advice. First, get your ScrumMaster to talk with Sita and also ask her to coach some of your events. She’s a ScrumMaster in the asset servicing area. They’ve been multisite for almost two years, and she’ll have a lot of suggestions.”

“Second, plan for you and the entire Zombies team to spend a Sprint in Cluj as soon as possible. Work really close with them, all in one room. The Cluj team could come here to London, but you want to send a strong signal that they are important, in their site. Try to avoid making them feel that London is more important than Cluj for your group. And you’ll want to visit there regularly. Next, ...”

#### Multisite Sprint Planning Part One

Several Sprints later...

Ariel walks into the room. There’s a computer projector attached to a Mac laptop, displaying via Google Hangouts video a room in Cluj. The two representatives from the team at that site are sitting and waiting. All the team representatives have tablets or laptops with them.

Ariel says, “Welcome to Sprint Planning. Let’s get started. My offer of items this Sprint are highlighted in the Google Spreadsheet. Can you all see it? Good. Please enter your team names beside the items you want.”

That done, the group enters a Q&A phase to wrap up lingering questions about the items—there’s always more questions. The London representatives tape up some flip chart papers and start writing questions. The Cluj representatives enter their questions in separate sheets of a Google Spreadsheet. Ariel spends some time at the different paper flip charts, discussing answers and sketching on the paper. And she spends some time at the spreadsheet, typing in answers for the Cluj team, while also talking with them face to face via the Hangouts video session.

After about 30 minutes all the questions have been resolved, and Ariel asks everyone to sit down. She says, “Now that we’ve spent some time apart, let’s converge. Is there anything you’ve learned that you want to share with the other team reps, to help our alignment or coordination?”

Fifteen minutes later Ariel says, “Done! I’ll hang out here in the corner while you have your coordination discussion and prepare for Part Two.”

#### Multisite Overall PBR

People are coming in to the workshop room in London. Two computer projectors are set up. One shows a Hangouts video session of the workshop room in Cluj. The other displays a browser on Ariel’s computer.

Ariel says, “Let’s get started. I want to focus on splitting some of our current split items even smaller.”

Using a mind-mapping browser-based graphics tool, she starts to create some branches, while discussing with the group.

Afterwards, they use a Google Spreadsheet to discuss a single example for each of the new split items, so that the representatives at both sites get a lightweight but concrete understanding of the details.

Later, the group does estimation of the new items, using especially big “planning poker” cards that can be easily seen via Hangouts and the cameras, as displayed on the computer projectors.

#### Multisite Interactions and Tools

As the above story sketch shows, “face to face” interaction is still possible in a multisite team context—and it’s vital! Modern and free collaboration tools can be used similarly in a Sprint Review, overall Retrospective, and so forth.

## Onwards

**Whole product focus**—These stories give a feel for applying LeSS in the context of a Sprint and its events. Not emphasized but central to all the stories is the LeSS principle of whole product focus—all the teams together creating one common potentially shippable product increment delivered at the end of one common Sprint. That’s really important.

**Organizations and fake Scrum**—Also important is the organizational design that enables all this.

> Scaled Scrum is not a special scaled framework
> that happens to include “Scrum for each team”

> Scaled Scrum is Scrum scaled.

It’s easy to create “fake Large-Scale Scrum” groups that are going through the apparent motions of Scrum, but when you scratch below the surface you’ll see the situation is largely the same as the old status quo, but with new Scrum or agile terms pasted on top. So large groups end up with:

* the “analysis Scrum team” writing the user stories
* the “UX Scrum team” delivering the wireframe UX stories
* the “architecture Scrum team” making up PowerPoint stories
* many “programming Scrum teams” each with their own team-level so-called “Product Backlog”
* the “testing Scrum team”

...all working towards the command to “deliver the project by the end date; let us know when it’s all done” and directed by a project manager fake ScrumMaster.

That just sucks.

So, since real Large-Scale Scrum starts with *changing the organization rather than changing Scrum*, the next few chapters focus on LeSS organizational design and its adoption.

        <h1><a href="/framework/why-less"> - Why LeSS?</a></h1>
        
        <div class="content">
            Traditional sequential-lifecycle development doesn't work well. It doesn't work well for either small or large product development efforts. Since 2001, Agile development and Scrum in particular have revolutionized software development, but when asked how to apply Agile development to large groups many people say "don't" or "just use a small team" or "do Scrum at the team level.” None of those answers is particularly useful, and while it is true that it is best to avoid adding people to your development effort, it is also true that large scale product development isn’t going away so we need to discover ways to do it well.

We (Craig and Bas) have been involved in software development for a long time in all sorts of roles in traditional sequential-lifecycle development, Unified Process, CMMi and others. None felt *right*. Scrum, on the other hand, felt right for single-team development. So, the question then became "How can we scale Scrum *without* losing its strength?"

## LeSS is Scrum scaled

What is the strength of Scrum? That is not an easy question to answer. Of course, the concepts and principles behind Scrum, such as [Transparency](../principles/transparency.html), [Empirical Process Control](../principles/empirical_process_control), Iterative development, and [Self-managing teams](../management/self_managing_teams.html) are critical. Those principles have been around for quite a while, however, so their inclusion does not explain Scrum’s success. After much discussion, we have concluded:

Scrum hits the sweet spot between abstract principles and concrete practices.
{: .box_top_bottom  .text_centered_bold }

Thus, in order to keep [Large-scale Scrum as Scrum](../principles/large_scale_scrum_is_scrum.html), we'll need to find a similar balance, so that we will be able to say:

For large groups, LeSS hits the sweet spot between defined concrete elements and empirical process control.
{: .box_top_bottom  .text_centered_bold }

This leads to some decisions:

* LeSS needs to be simple
When scaling, there is a tendency to add roles, artifacts, processes, etc. This should be avoided so that a process can empirically be created by the product group. Most other scaling frameworks fall into the trap of providing a defined process. In LeSS we want to avoid that trap.
* LeSS is Scrum Scaled
  Rather than having Scrum as a building block for a scaled framework, we need to look at Scrum and for each element ask "Why is it there?" followed by “If we have more than one team, how can we achieve the same purpose on a larger scale?”
* Scaled up instead of tailored down
A common concept for process development is to define a universal, overarching framework and then contextually tailor it down. This does not work well because people often assume everything is needed in their particular context. This assumption often leads to the creation of bloated processes. LeSS should be kept to the minimum. We acknowledge that scaling will require “more” but instead of “polluting” LeSS with optional elements, we have separated out a different framework [LeSS Huge](../less-huge/index.html).

## LeSS uses experiments

In our first two books, [Scaling Agile and Lean Development](http://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Lean-Agile-Development-Organizational/dp/0321480961) and [Practices for Scaling Agile and Lean Development](http://www.amazon.com/Practices-Scaling-Lean-Agile-Development/dp/0321636406), we framed large-scale Scrum as a set of experiments with the principle:

There are no such things as best practices. There are only practices that are good within a certain context.
{: .box_top_bottom  .text_centered_bold }

Thus, the books are full of experiments that we have done. Certain things we recommend you try, certain things we recommend you avoid, and others we caution will work in some contexts but are terrible in others. This worked well and we have received a lot of positive feedback about this approach. 

We also got feedback from people who were a bit confused. They needed more to hold on to... something less context-specific ... some rules. Based on this feedback, we reflected and returned to the Shu Ha Ri model of learning:

<figure>
  <img src="/img/framework/shuhari.png" alt="shuhari.png">
</figure>

This model shows the different stages that learners go through when learning new concepts:

* Shu---Follow rules to learn basics
* Ha---Break rules and discover context
* Ri---Mastery and find your own way

We realized that our previous scaling work did not provide anything on the shu level, which caused difficulty and confusion for people who had just started agile development in large product groups. This became even more obvious when other, more predictive scaling approaches started offering beginner level advice. Hence...

## LeSS as a framework

LeSS is more than a set of principles and experiments. It also provides a framework with rules. The [LeSS Rules](../rules/index.html) define what is LeSS (and what isn't) and they provide a concrete framework for applying LeSS. Within the LeSS Framework, product groups can apply the experiments and discover what works best for them at a certain moment.

This is also the basis of the third LeSS book, simply called [Large-Scale Scrum](http://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Scrum-More-Craig-Larman/dp/0321985710). In this book, LeSS is defined as:

* LeSS Rules that provide the LeSS framework (and the LeSS Huge framework for larger product groups)
* Guides for adopting LeSS
* Experiments from the first two books.

This way ensures that LeSS is simple and stays true to the Scrum nature. Yet, like Scrum, LeSS provides enough concrete practices to start and enough flexibility and power to scale.

Traditional sequential-lifecycle development doesn't work well. It doesn't work well for either small or large product development efforts. Since 2001, Agile development and Scrum in particular have revolutionized software development, but when asked how to apply Agile development to large groups many people say "don't" or "just use a small team" or "do Scrum at the team level.” None of those answers is particularly useful, and while it is true that it is best to avoid adding people to your development effort, it is also true that large scale product development isn’t going away so we need to discover ways to do it well.
--->

開発プロダクトの大小にかかわらず、従来型のシーケンシャルなライフサイクルに基づく開発はうまくいかないものです。2001年以降、アジャイル開発手法（特にスクラム）はソフトウェア開発に革命をもたらしましたが、大きな開発グループにアジャイルを適用することに対しては「やめておけ」、「あくまで小さなチーム向けだから…」、「スクラムはチームレベルに閉じて行うべき」といったネガティブなコメントをする人間が多いというのが現実です。開発チームに人を追加しすぎる事は避けるべきという見解は確かに正しいものの、大規模プロダクト開発がこの世から消えることはないことを考えると、うまくアジャイル開発手法を大規模プロダクト開発に適用させる方法を発見する必要があるのは明白です。

<!---
We (Craig and Bas) have been involved in software development for a long time in all sorts of roles in traditional sequential-lifecycle development, Unified Process, CMMi and others. None felt *right*. Scrum, on the other hand, felt right for single-team development. So, the question then became "How can we scale Scrum *without* losing its strength?"
--->

我々（Craig と Bas）は、長きに渡り、従来型のシーケンシャルなライフサイクルに基づく開発、Unified Process、CMMi等といったソフトウェア開発手法において色々な役割を経験してきましたがどれも *正しい* と感じることができませんでした。一方でスクラムは単独チームによる開発に限って言えば正しい手法であると感じました。このことから、我々は「いかに *スクラムの長所を殺すこと無く* スケールさせるか」を考えるようになりました。

What is the strength of Scrum? That is not an easy question to answer. Of course, the concepts and principles behind Scrum, such as [Transparency](../principles/transparency.html), [Empirical Process Control](../principles/empirical_process_control), Iterative development, and [Self-managing teams](../management/self_managing_teams.html) are critical. Those principles have been around for quite a while, however, so their inclusion does not explain Scrum’s success. After much discussion, we have concluded:
--->

そもそもスクラムの強みとは何でしょう？これは簡単に答えられる質問ではありません。当然ながら、[透明性](../principles/transparency.html)や[経験則に基づくプロセスコントロール](../principles/empirical_process_control)、イテレーションによる開発、[自己管理化されたチーム](../management/self_managing_teams.html)等といった、スクラムの背景にある概念や原則はとても重要です。しかし、これらの原則はかなり昔から提唱されていたものであり、これらがスクラムが成功した原因であるとは言い切れない面があります。

議論を重ねた結果、我々は次のように結論に至りました。

<!---
Scrum hits the sweet spot between abstract principles and concrete practices.
{: .box_top_bottom  .text_centered_bold }

スクラムは、抽象的な原則と具体的な慣行との間のスイート・スポットをうまく捉えている。

Thus, in order to keep [Large-scale Scrum as Scrum](../principles/large_scale_scrum_is_scrum.html), we'll need to find a similar balance, so that we will be able to say:

そこで、我々は[スクラムを大規模スクラム](../principles/large_scale_scrum_is_scrum.html)として維持するためには、同じようなバランスを保つ必要があると考えました。すなわち、次のように考えたのです。

大規模チーム開発向けに、LeSS は具体的に定義された要素と経験則に基づくプロセスコントロールとの間のスイートスポットをうまく捉える必要がある。

This leads to some decisions:

* LeSS needs to be simple
When scaling, there is a tendency to add roles, artifacts, processes, etc. This should be avoided so that a process can empirically be created by the product group. Most other scaling frameworks fall into the trap of providing a defined process. In LeSS we want to avoid that trap.
* LeSS is Scrum Scaled

--->

このことを踏まえ、我々は次のように方向性を定めました。

* LeSS はシンプルでなければならない
開発プロセスのスケールアップを検討する際、役割や成果物、プロセスなどを増やしてしまう傾向があります。開発グループによる経験則に基づいたプロセスを促進するために、これは避けなければなりません。プロセスをかっちりと定義してしまうという罠に数多くの「スケール性」を謳うフレームワークが陥っています。LeSS はこの罠を回避するもにしたいと我々は考えました。

* LeSS はスケールしたスクラムである
スクラムをスケールしたフレームワークの構成要素として捉えるのではなく、スクラムの各要素に対して「この要素が存在する目的は何か？」、「複数チームを前提にした場合、同じ目的をより大きなスケールで実現するためにはどうすればよいか？」を検討する必要があると考えました。

* そぎ落としではなくスケールアップ
プロセス開発の一般的な考え方は、まず汎用的・包括的なフレームワークを定義し、これをコンテキストに応じてそぎ落としていくというものです。しかし我々はこの考え方はうまくいかないと考えました。あるコンテキスト実現のためにすべての要素が必要であると考えてしまうことが多いため、結果としてプロセスが肥大化してしまうことが多いのです。もちろんスケールアップのための「要素追加」は必要ですが、要素追加で LeSS を「汚染」する代わりに、我々は [LeSS Huge](../less-huge/index.html) という別のフレームワークを用意することを選択しました。

        <h1><a href="/framework/product-owner"> - Product Owner</a></h1>
        
        <div class="content">
            The Product Owner role in LeSS is conceptually the same as in one-team Scrum. However, at scale the focus changes slightly toward keeping an overview and ensuring the maximum return on investment (ROI) in the product.

## Scaled Product Owner

It’s common in large-scale product development for different people to pull in different directions and for subgroups to focus on local sub-optimizations. Maintaining one Product Owner with one Product Backlog supports [whole-product focus](../principles/whole-product-focus.html).

In traditional large-scale product groups, there’s a group (often product managers) that focuses outward  and a group (usually developers) that focuses inward  — and never the twain shall meet. In LeSS, the one Product Owner has lots of free time to focus outward on customers and their priorities while also being able to spend some time looking inwards to the teams. He acts as a connector, bringing teams and customers/users together so the teams become more [customer focused](../principles/customer_centric.html).

In contrast with other scaled Scrum approaches, it’s possible in LeSS to effectively scale the Product Owner role with just one person because there are fewer roles and positions, and less complexity.

## Prioritization over Clarification

There are two key information flows in Scrum related to the Product Owner: (1) prioritizing (ordering) items in the Product Backlog and (2) clarifying items in the Product Backlog. In the first flow (prioritization), information related to profit drivers, strategic customers, business risks, and other business concerns is sought and analyzed. In the second flow (clarification), information is sought to detail the behavior and qualities of items, the user experience, and other feature design concerns.

A LeSS Product Owner focuses on thinking hard about prioritization but collaborates with the teams on clarification. Further, he encourages and helps the teams enter into a direct conversation with true users and customers for clarification. He acts as a connector, not an intermediary.

Why emphasize direct interaction between teams and customers/users? Reasons include: (1) avoiding information loss from handoffs, (2) fostering co-creation of solutions to real customer problems, and (3) improving motivation and empathy for customers by having developers collaborate with them directly.

It’s worth noting that when the teams do most of the clarification work the Product Owner has more time and energy to focus on the big picture, continuously prioritizing and exploring new and strategic opportunities.

## Find a Product Owner Given Your Type of Development

### Step 1: Know Your Development Type

Finding the right Product Owner depends on knowing the type of development you are doing:

* **Product development**---For external customers or a market.
* **Internal (product) development**---For one or more users within the company. The development group is usually called IT or Systems Development.
* **Project development**---Usually for one external customer. The work is organized and contracted as a project of some kind although that does not necessarily mean a fixed scope/date/cost project contract. The development company is usually an outsourcer or systems-integrator. The customer, or client company, includes both the purchasing entity and the users, who are not always in the same department.

### Step 2: Finding the right Product Owner

**Product development**---The company will have either (1) a business unit driving the product initiative (e.g., Retail Banking), or (2) a Product Management department driving the initiative. Traditional Product Management is responsible for customer and competitor analysis, product vision, coarse-grained feature selection and prioritization, product roadmap, and other non-technical activities. They don’t manage the work of a traditional development group.

Where to find a Product Owner for a group adopting LeSS? If there’s a Product Management department, then a Product Manager can be a good choice. Otherwise, look for a person from the business unit that’s driving the initiative. The important thing to keep in mind is that the Product Owner for product development should come from the business side.

**Internal (product) development**---A good Product Owner for internal product development in LeSS is (1) from within the group that will use the system, and (2) is closely involved in and deeply experienced in doing the real work that the system will support. They are very close to the real users.

**Project development**---The key point for project development is that the Product Owner be from the company receiving the system. As with internal development, they should be involved in and deeply experienced in the hands-on work the system will support, and be close to users.

A common variant for both internal and project development is when the system will be used by many departments. Then, a good choice is an experienced, hands-on individual from one of the major user departments who is interested in taking on the role and has political savvy.

In all cases, a great Product Owner has a passion for the product.

When it is impossible to find the right Product Owner immediately, you can quickly start a LeSS adoption with a *temporary* Product Owner who understands what’s going on and can perform the mechanics of the role but is not from the business side. Let the teams complete several Sprints under the temporary Product Owner until the major kinks are worked out and — this is important — the development teams can deliver a truly ‘done’, shippable increment (or something close) every Sprint. Why? The product teams will be more likely to find and inspire the right longterm Product Owner if they can show a compelling new capability that offers very tangible business benefit. It’s terribly important that everyone understand that the temporary Product Owner is a placeholder. We often use the term “fake Product Owner” to indicate just how damaging this temporary Product Owner can be. Because the fake PO is not only not the best Product Owner but also he can cause damage trying to fill a role for which he is not qualified. He must be replaced as soon as possible to avoid the risk of creating a second-class product.

### Step 3: Give Authority and Responsibility to a Real Product Owner

Product Owner is not a new name for a traditional project manager who delivers a scope and date contract of work. Rather, a Product Owner must have the independent authority to choose and change content, release dates, priorities, vision, etc. Of course he collaborates with stakeholders, but a real Product Owner has final decision-making authority.

## Five Relationships

The Product Owner needs to understand and work to improve five key relationships that are affected by LeSS adoption:

* **Product Owner<–>Teams**
  The teams are there to help the Product Owner create the best possible product for the customer. They need to know what to build next and whether or not what they have already built has hit the mark. The Product Owner needs to know what the teams need and how he can help them.
* **Product Owner<–>Customers**
  The Product Owner and teams are trying to create the best possible product for the customer. The customer needs to know when they will have features they care about, and perhaps the reasoning behind the priorities. Involve them as much as possible by being transparent. The Product Owner needs to learn their real goals or problems with them (or envision something beyond their vision) and collect the information that will help him prioritize well.
* **Teams<–>Customers**
  The teams are trying to create the best possible product for the customer. They need to know the context for features and have detailed domain knowledge. Ideally, teams co-create solutions directly with customers by grasping the customers’ essential (rather than superficial) goals and problems. Teams need to confirm with customers that they fully understand the requirements they are clarifying together.
* **Product Owner<–>Higher Management**
  Higher management beyond the product group (portfolio managers, C-level executives, etc.) should view the Product Owner as having the final accountability and responsibility for product success. He is responsible for making the development status visible and realizing higher management’s (perhaps implicit) mandate to optimize desired impacts (e.g., ROI and market share). The Product Owner, with support from ScrumMasters, engages higher management’s help to improve the organizational design.
* **Product Owner<->ScrumMasters**
  The relationships above are directly related to “product ownership,” but this one is different. It relates to Product Owner knowledge and behavior. The ScrumMasters need to know the Product Owner’s concerns, questions, and obstacles so they can help. A good ScrumMaster can be a friendly ear or a shoulder to cry on. ScrumMasters educate and feed back so Product Owners can adapt. 

## LeSS Meetings

When we introduce LeSS, a frequent question is, “How is one Product Owner going to manage all of those meetings with all of those teams?” Fortunately, the concern behind that question is based on a misunderstanding. The one Product Owner in LeSS only attends single meetings even though there are multiple teams. And the number of team members at those single meetings is manageable. If there are just two teams, everyone can effectively attend and participate. If there are many teams, only two representatives from each team may attend.

What LeSS meetings does the Product Owner attend and what is their average duration in a typical two-week Sprint?

* [Sprint Planning One](sprint-planning-one.html) - 1 hour.
* [Overall Product Backlog Refinement (PBR)](product-backlog-refinement.html) - 4 hours
* [Sprint Review](sprint-review.html) - 2 hours.
* [Overall Retrospective](overall-retrospective.html) - 1.5 hours.

So the total time spent in LeSS events is, on average, about eight hours in a two-week Sprint.

The Product Owner does not attend the team-specific meetings: [Sprint Planning Two](sprint-planning-two.html), [Daily Scrums](daily-scrum.html), [team PBRs](product-backlog-refinement.html), [team Retrospectives](retrospective.html).

Here is a side note regarding tool usage in Scrum and in LeSS. It is common for organizations to look for tools to solve their problems even though tools are rarely the cause of the problem. Avoid solving problems with tools unless you truly, deeply understand the problem and consider a tool to be the the right solution for that particular problem.

* 参加者を制限する。 2つだけのチームの場合、チーム全体が参加できる。2つ以上のチームの場合は、チームごとに1人か2人の代表者を送る （スクラムマスターは、代表者となるべきではない）。
* プロダクトオーナーは、プロダクトバックログの優先度の最も高い項目をチームに提示する。
* チームは自分たちで項目を配分する。
* 項目に関する（以前の[プロダクトバックログ・リファインメント](product-backlog-refinement.jp.html) で解決されていない）未解決の問題があれば何でも議論する。

## Sprint Planning Overview

In LeSS, Sprint Planning One is a meeting of all of the Teams together. At the meeting, the teams collectively decide which items each team will work on. Each team conducts its own Sprint Planning Two meeting where the team creates its plan for getting the items to 'done' during the Sprint.

## Multi-team Sprint Planning Two

It is common for two teams to work on similar related features or work on different features that affect the same components. In that case, it can be useful to have a Multi-team Sprint Planning Two meeting. This is done by having the teams meet in the same physical location with each team conducting its own Sprint Planning Two. That way the teams can:

* have a shared design session,
* ask questions of one another at any time,
* coordinate shared work,
* find other opportunities to work together and learn from each other (e.g. cross-team pair programming).

        <h1><a href="/framework/coordination-and-integration"> - Coordination & Integration</a></h1>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>Scrum values decentralized, self-organized coordination and integration over the centralized, controlled coordination found in traditional project management. LeSS coordination and integration concentrates on how to support decentralized coordination while providing enough boundaries and structure to avoid chaos.</p>

<h2 id="just-talk">Just Talk</h2>

<p>Probably the best way to coordinate between teams is to simply coordinate between the teams. Any member of a self-managing team would be able and expected to reach out to another team if there is an issue to be discussed. When there is a need for coordination then “just talk” by going to the other team, picking up the phone or, in the worst case, dropping them an email. You do not need a formal, official, usually slow coordination mechanism in order to coordinate. Get up and talk to people.</p>

<h2 id="communicate-in-code">Communicate in Code</h2>

<p>LeSS groups adopt <a href="../technical-excellence/continuous-integration">continuous integration</a>, which means that everyone has all their code checked in to the central repository mainline (branches are an unnecessary complication that should be avoided). Everyone in the product teams synchronizes with the repository several times a day and will get all the changes that other people have made.</p>

<p>So, when you update, spend two minutes going over the changes that were made by others and see if they relate to what you are working on now. If so, feel free to get up and “just talk” in order to synchronize your work with the others!</p>

<h2 id="send-observers-to-the-daily-scrum">Send Observers to the Daily Scrum</h2>

<p>A simple coordination method for teams is to send a representative —not the ScrumMaster—as a silent observer to the Daily Scrum of other teams doing related work. The observers then report back to their teams so they can take further action.</p>

<h2 id="component-communities-and-guardians">Component communities and guardians</h2>

<p>People working on the same components at the same time need to know of each other so they can ask questions and review each other’s code. Do this by creating component <a href="../structure/communities.html">Communities of Practice</a> (CoPs), which should communicate via mailing lists, chat, occasional meetings, and other remote collaboration channels.</p>

<p>These communities are often organized by a “component guardian” who is usually a member of a feature team who has taken some additional responsibilities such as (1) being the teacher of how a component works, (2) monitoring the long-term health of a component, (3) organizing a component community, (4) organizing design workshops, and (5) reviewing code.</p>

<p>A component guardian doesn’t review code for approval before it’s committed. He’s a teacher and steward of the component, not a gate.</p>

<p>A component may have several guardians who share the work and thereby reduce key-person dependency.</p>

<p>Important!… Besides helping coordination, these practices help maintain or improve the code/design quality of a component, and increase learning.</p>

<h2 id="scrum-of-scrums">Scrum of Scrums</h2>

<p>A Scrum of Scrums meeting is a Daily-Scrum-like meeting between teams, typically held two or three times per week.</p>

<p>Does it have to involve all teams? No. Subsets of teams can do it when they have a compelling need to coordinate.</p>

<p>A healthy Scrum of Scrums meeting is attended by team members who do actual development work and not ScrumMasters or the Product Owner. The people in the Scrum of Scrums are there for the sole purpose of coordinating real work between teams.</p>

<p>Usually the format is three questions, similar to a Daily Scrum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What did my team do that is relevant to other teams?</li>
  <li>What will my team do that is relevant?</li>
  <li>What are my team’s obstacles that other teams should know about or can help with?</li>
</ul>

<p>Naturally, use and evolve whatever questions your group finds useful.</p>

<p>A caution: The desire to hold a Scrum of Scrums can be a sign of unnecessary dependency or coordination problems caused by single-function groups and component teams, or by teams not able or willing to identify and do shared work.</p>

<p>It can also be a sign of ScrumMasters who are actually team leads or managers getting together for a “leadership meeting.” Don’t let that happen because it will tend to diminish the self-organization of the teams involved as they sense that someone is taking over command and control leadership.</p>

<h2 id="multi-team-meetings">Multi-team meetings</h2>

<p>It is common for some teams to need to work closely together whereas others may not feel that need. For teams that work closely together, it is common to have multi-team LeSS meetings. Some examples would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multi-team <a href="product-backlog-refinement.html">Product Backlog Refinement</a></li>
  <li>Multi-team <a href="sprint-planning_two.html">Sprint Planning Two</a></li>
  <li>Multi-team <a href="../technical-excellence/architecture-design.html">Design Workshops</a></li>
  <li>Exchange members in Daily Scrum.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="travelers-to-exploit-and-break-bottlenecks-and-create-skill">Travelers to exploit and break bottlenecks and create skill</h2>

<p>Sometimes a product group relies on a couple of experienced technical experts. How can the knowledge of these (scarce) experts be kept available to all teams? They can become travelers. Each Sprint they join a different team, coaching via pairing, workshops, and teaching sessions.</p>

<p>Although travelers are not specifically created for coordination, by joining different teams they create or strengthen a broad network, which is exactly what is needed for informal coordination channels. And they increase the consistency of some knowledge or practice across teams, realizing a coordination goal.</p>

<h2 id="leading-team">Leading Team</h2>

<p>In some domains, features are monstrously large. When you split these giants into smaller Product Backlog Items, it can require many teams working closely together, each separately on its own PBI, to create a single monster feature.</p>

<p>Another technique for coordinating teams working together on the split items of a big related feature is a leading team. A leading team is just a regular feature team that takes a leading role for the overall giant feature. In addition to doing development work, they are responsible for keeping track of what the other teams are doing and helping them synchronize. In short, they organize cross-team coordination related to the giant in addition to themselves doing development.</p>

<p>Sometimes several teams start implementing the giant at the same time. At other times, the leading team starts alone to focus the early knowledge transfer and simplify the creation of a cohesive design. After a few Sprints, more teams join. In this case the lead team also has a teaching responsibility to help the incoming teams learn what they already know.</p>

* [継続的に改善](../principles/continuous-improvement-towards-perfection.jp.html)出来るように短いフィードバックサイクルを維持する

<!---
Potentially shippable is a statement about the quality of the software and not about the value or the marketability of the software.” When a product is potentially shippable then that means "that all the work that needs to be done for the currently implemented features has been done and technically the product can be shipped" but it doesn't mean that "the features implemented are valuable enough for the customer to want a new release". The latter is determined by the [Product Owner](product-owner.html).
--->
出荷可能とは、ソフトウェアの市場性または価値ではなく、ソフトウェアの品質についての声明である。
プロダクトが出荷可能であるとは、
技術的にプロダクトが出荷可能であり、現在実装したフィーチャーに必要な作業が完成していることを意味する。
実装されたフィーチャーが、新しいリリースをしたい顧客にとって、十分に価値があることを意味してはいない。
後者は、プロダクトオーナーによって決定される。

<!---
Whether the product is truly shippable will depend on the current [Definition of Done](definition-of-done.html). If there is a perfect definition of done, then the product can be shipped each Sprint. If the [Definition of Done](definition-of-done.html) is weak, then there will still be work to be done, leading to less transparency, less flexibility and increased development risk.
--->

プロダクトが本当に出荷可能であるかどうかは、現在の[完成の定義](definition-of-done.jp.html)に依存します。
完全な完成の定義が存在する場合は、そのプロダクトは、各スプリントごとに出荷することが出来ます。
[完成の定義](definition-of-done.jp.html)が弱い場合は、少ない透明性、少ない柔軟性そして、開発リスクの増加につながり、まだ完成させるための作業があります。

Scrum’s inspect-adapt cycles require transparency in order to be effective. Formally defining the meaning of ‘done’ reduces variability and the likelihood of undone work and measuring progress unambiguously (‘done’ or ‘not done’) increases transparency.
--->
<p>スクラムの検査と適応のサイクルが有効であるために、透明性を必要とします。
正式に”完成”の意味を定義することは、未完了作業の見込みと、曖昧さの無い進捗状況(”完成”または”完成しない”)を測定することで、ばらつきを低減させ、透明性を向上させる。
<!---
A perfect Definition of Done includes everything that the organization has to do to deliver the product to customers. Achieving this should be relatively easy for a one-team product group. When the team isn’t able to achieve the perfect Definition of Done then they define ‘done’ as a subset of the perfect set. The team’s goal is to improve so that, one day, their Definition of Done is perfect and they can ship each Sprint or more.

完璧な完成の定義は、組織が顧客にプロダクトを提供するために行う必要がある全ての作業が含まれています。これを達成するには、1チームのプロダクトグループのために比較的簡単にする必要があります。
チームは、完璧な完成の定義を達成することが出来ない場合は、完璧な完成の定義のサブセットとして’完成’を明確にする。チームの目標は、完成の定義を完璧なものとする。そしてスプリント毎またはそれ以上に出荷できるようにするように、完成の定義を改善することです。</p>

The Definition of Done is an agreed list of criteria that the software will meet for each Product Backlog Item. Achieving this level of completeness requires the Team to perform a list of tasks. When all tasks are completed, the item is done. Don’t confuse the Definition of Done with acceptance criteria, which are specific conditions an individual item has to fulfill to be accepted. The Definition of Done applies uniformly to all Product Backlog items.
--->
<p>完成の定義は、ソフトウェアのプロダクトバックログアイテムについて満たす基準を合意した一覧です。完全なこのレベルを達成するタスクリストを実行するチームを必要とする。全てのタスクが完了すると、プロダクトバックログアイテムは、完成になります。個々のプロダクトバックログアイテムが受け入れられるために満たさなければならない特定の条件である受入基準と完成の定義を混同しないでください。完成の定義は、全てのプロダクトバックログアイテムに均一に適用されます。
<!---
## Creating the Definition of Done
--->
## 完成の定義を作成する
<!---
The initial Definition of Done must be agreed before the first Sprint. This usually happens in the [Initial Product Backlog Refinement workshop](initial-product-backlog-refinement.html).
--->
完成の最初の定義は、最初のスプリントの前に合意する必要があります。
これは通常、<a href="initial-product-backlog-refinement.html">初期プロダクトバックログリファインメントのワークショップ</a>で行われます。
<!---
The following steps are taken in order to create the Definition of Done:
* Define the activities needed to ship to end customers.
* Decide which activities can be done each Sprint.
--->
完成の定義を作成するためには次の手順を行います。
* 顧客に出荷するために必要なアクティビティを定義します。
* 各スプリントで完成出来るアクティビティを決定します。
<!---
Let’s explore these steps in more detail.
--->
それでは、より詳細にこれらのステップを探索してみましょう。
<!---
### Define the activities needed to ship to end customers
--->
顧客に出荷するのに必要なアクティビティを定義します。
<!---
They key question is, “What activities are currently required to ship our product?”
--->
キーとなる質問は、「実際、私達のプロダクトを出荷するのに必要なアクティビティは何ですか？」です。
<!---
* Shipping means “delivering to end customers” and not “send out of the development department.”
* Challenge the need for intermediate artifacts. Do we really need that specification document?
--->
* 出荷するとは、”顧客にデリバリーする”を意味し、”開発部門の手を離れる”ということではありません。
* 中間成果物の必要性に挑む。本当にその仕様書は必要ですか？
<!---
The teams write post-it notes with required activities. These include activities such as coding and testing but may also include setting up customer support, creating hardware, or even marketing activities. We refer to this list as the required activities for having a Potentially Shippable Product.
--->
チームは必要なアクティビティをポスト・イットに書きます。これらは、コーディングやテストなどのアクティビティが含まれるだけではなく、顧客サポート、ハードウェアの構築、マーケティングなどを含んでも良いです。
<!---
With this step, you have created a [perfection goal](../principles/continuous-improvement-towards-perfection.html) for the organization—do all these activities for each item every Sprint. Product groups now often realize this will take a lot of improvements.
--->
この手順を行うと、全てのスプリントでのプロダクトバックログアイテムごとのアクティビティを行うことで、組織にとって完璧な目標を作成することが出来ます。プロダクトグループでは、多くの場合は、沢山の改善を行わなければならない。
<!---
### Decide which activities can be done each Sprint
--->
### スプリント毎に完成出来るアクティビティを決定します。
<!---
The key question is, “Considering our current context and capability, what activities can be completed each Sprint?” This subset is the initial Definition of Done. A Definition of Done is weak when it is a small subset and strong when it is almost equals Potentially Shippable.
--->
キーとなる質問は、「現在のコンテキストと能力を考え、アクティビティを各スプリントで終わらせることが出来るか？」です。このサブセットは、初期の完成の定義です。ほとんど出荷可能と等しい場合は、強くそして、小さいサブセットの場合は弱い完成の定義です。
<!---
The teams discuss their context and select the subset of the activities that all teams think they realistically can do during the Sprint. This is their initial Definition of Done (see example in Figure 1). The teams that can do more will expand this product Definition of Done within their teams.
--->
チームは、コンテキストと、全てのチームがスプリントの間中、現実的に出来るアクティビティのサブセットの選択を議論する。これは、(図1の例を参照)彼らの最初の完成の定義です。より多くを行うことが出来るチームは、完成の定義を拡張していきます。</p>

<!---
The difference between the Definition of Done and Potentially Shippable is referred to as Undone Work. The Sprint is planned according to the Definition of Done and thus the Undone Work is excluded—it is planned to be left undone
--->
<p>完成の定義と出荷可能の差は、未完了作業と呼ばれます。スプリントは、完成の定義に従って計画される。したがって、未完了作業は除外される。それは完成しないものは残る計画となる。</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/img/framework/dod.jpg" alt="dod.jpg" />
  <figcaption>図1. 出荷可能と完成の定義</figcaption>
</figure>

<!---
## Definition of Done terms
--->
<p>## 完成の定義の条件
<!---
The terms Potentially Shippable and Definition of Done are often not used consistently, but in LeSS they have very precise meaning. To clarify the terms:
--->
出荷可能と完成の定義の条件は、相変わらず利用されていないが、LeSSではとても明確な意味を持つ。条件を明確にするには:</p>

<!---
**Potentially Shippable**—All activities that must be performed before the product can be shipped.
--->
<p><strong>出荷可能</strong> - 実行されなければならない全てのアクティビティを完了して初めて出荷することが出来る</p>

<!---
**Definition of Done**—An agreement between the teams and the Product Owner on which activities are performed inside the Sprint. A Definition of Done is perfect when it equals to Potentially Shippable. The teams strive to improve towards a perfect Definition of Done.
--->
<p><strong>完成の定義</strong> - スプリントで行うアクティビティをプロダクトオーナーとチームで合意する。
合意した内容が、出荷可能出来る状態であるならば完成の定義は完璧です。
チームは、完成の定義を完璧にするために改善に努めます。</p>

<!---
**Undone Work**—The difference between the Definition of Done and Potentially Shippable. When the Definition of Done is perfect then there is no Undone Work. If this isn’t the case then the organization has to decide, (1) How do we deal with the Undone Work, and (2) How do we improve so that there is less Undone Work in the future.
--->
<p><strong>未完了作業(Undone Work)</strong> - 完成の定義と出荷可能との違い。完成の定義が完全である場合は、未完了作業はありません。そうで無い場合は、組織は決定をしなければならない。(1)どのように未完了作業を対処するのか。(2)どのように将来的に未完了作業を少なくするための改善を行うのか。</p>

<!---
**Unfinished, not finished, or not done**—Work that was planned in a Sprint but wasn’t completed. This is often confused with Undone Work. ‘Unfinished’ is work that the team planned for but didn’t finish whereas Undone Work was never even planned for. When a team has work that was not finished then they ought to feel anxious and discuss improvement actions during their Retrospective.
--->
<p><strong>未完成、着手中、完成しない</strong> - スプリントで計画されたが、完了しなかった作業。
これは多くの場合、未完了作業と混同されています。
未完成は、チームは計画したが終わらなかった作業なのに対し、未完了作業は、計画さえしていない。
チームは、作業が途中になってしまった場合は、彼らは不安に感じるべきで、レトロスペクティブの間に改善活動を議論するべきです。
<!---
Teams should never leave work-in-progress at the end of the Sprint and “carry over” to the next one. This causes a lack of transparency and reduces scope flexibility. If they forecast too much work, they need to remove complete items which they haven’t started yet.
--->
チームは、スプリントの最後に決してワークインプログレスを残すべきではないし、次に持ち越すべきでは無い。これは透明性の欠如を引き起こし、スコープの柔軟性を低下させる。
もしチームがあまりにも多くの作業を計画した場合は、まだ開始されていない項目一式を削除する必要がある。</p>

<!---
### Mathematics of Done
--->
<p class="box_top_bottom text_centered_bold">### 完成の数学
<!---
Potentially Shippable = Definition of Done + Undone Work
Work in Iteration = Product Backlog Item * Definition of Done
--->
出荷可能 = 完成の定義 + 未完了作業
イテレーションの作業 = プロダクトバックログアイテム * 完成の定義</p>

<!---
## Undone Work -> Risk and Delay
--->
<p>未完了作業 -&gt; リスクと遅延
<!---
Let’s first explore the effects of Undone Work by running through a scenario.
--->
それでは、シナリオを通して、未完了作業の効果を最初に調査してみよう。</p>

<!---
The teams completed—according to the Definition of Done—twenty Product Backlog Items in the first Sprint. They have no unfinished work but there is a lot of Undone Work due to their weak Definition of Done. After the teams completed—according to the weak Definition of Done—forty Product Backlog Items in three Sprints. The amount of Undone Work has grown enormously causing a false sense of progress.
--->
<p>チームは - 完成の定義に従って - 最初のスプリントで20プロダクトバックログアイテムを完了した。未完成の作業は残っていないが、多くの未完了作業がある。原因は、彼らの弱い完成の定義にある。その後、チームは - 弱い完成の定義に従って - 3スプリントで40のプロダクトバックログアイテムを完成した。未完了作業の量は、進捗の誤った感覚を引き起こして、非常に成長した。</p>

<!---
But they can’t ship. They have ‘done’ the features but their weak Definition of Done caused a vast amount of Undone Work to accumulate. This Undone Work causes delay and hidden risk.
--->
<p>しかし、彼らは出荷出来ない。彼らはフィーチャーは完成しているが、弱い完成の定義が原因で、膨大な量の未完了作業が溜まっている。この未完了作業は、遅延と隠されたリスクの原因となった。</p>

<!---
**Delay**—Extra effort is needed to perform the Undone Work. This causes a lack of flexibility for the Product Owner—he can’t directly respond to market needs and changes. The pain caused by this delay is aggravated by the fact that the effort to complete the Undone Work is highly variable and thus hard to predict.
--->
<p><strong>遅延</strong>- 未完了作業を行うのに余分な手間が必要になります。これはプロダクトオーナーは、直接市場のニーズや変化に対応することが出来きないため、柔軟性の欠如を引き起こします。
未完了作業を完了するための取り組みは、非常に変わりやすく、予測することが困難であるという事実によって、この遅延による痛みは、悪化します。</p>

<!---
**Risk**—The Undone Work causes a lack of transparency. Risks are hidden in it. For example, if performance testing is left Undone then it delays the risk of a non-performing system until close to release—when it hurts most.
--->
<p><strong>リスク</strong> - 未完了作業は透明性の欠如の原因となる。リスクはその中に隠されている。
例えば、パフォーマンステストが残っている場合は、システムのリリースの近く - 最も損害を与える時 - まで、不履行のリスクを遅らせる。</p>

<!---
A good Product Owner wants a perfect Definition of Done as that reduces product risk and avoids delay.
--->
<p>良いプロダクトオーナーは、プロダクトのリスクを削減し、遅延を回避するため、完璧な完成の定義を望んでいる。</p>

        <div class="content">
            The Overall Retrospective is a new meeting in LeSS. Its purpose is to retrospect on the previous Sprint(s) from a product perspective.

## Retrospective Overview

<figure>
  <img src="/img/framework/sprint-review-retrospective.png" alt="sprint-review-retrospective.png">
</figure>

## Questions to explore

In an Overall Retrospective, the systemic and organizational issues explored are above the level of a single team. Topics that might be discussed in an Overall Retrospective are:

* How well are the teams working together?
* Are the [Communities of Practice](../structure/communities.html) working?
* Is there something that a team did that should be shared?
* Are the teams learning together?
* Are teams close to customers?
* Are there systemic organizational issues that cause problems in how teams operate?
* Is the Product Owner doing well?
* Is the Product Owner maintaining his [five relationships](product-owner.html#five-relationships)?

## Participants

The Overall Retrospective is often attended by ScrumMasters and representatives of the different teams. The Product Owner should also be there, with managers optional.

## Timing

Conceptually, the Overall Retrospective occurs right after the team [Retrospectives](retrospective.html). Practically, this can pose a problem as the team Retrospectives are often at the end of the day at the end of a Sprint. Not only are people often exhausted, but they also don't have time to continue with another Retrospective meeting.

The common way out of this is to have the Overall Retrospective at the beginning of the next Sprint.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/framework/overall-retrospective-timing.png" alt="overall-retrospective-timing.png">
</figure>

## Systems Thinking

An important tool for Overall Retrospectives is to use [Cause-Effect Diagrams](../principles/systems_thinking.html). Having the participants pick an issue and explore the different causes together in front of a whiteboard can lead to big insights and real, useful changes.

        <div class="content">
            Ongoing Product Backlog Refinement (PBR) is needed within each Sprint to refine items to be ready for future Sprints. Key activities of PBR are (1) splitting big items, (2) detailing items until ready, and (3) estimating. In the spirit of [empirical process control](../principles/empirical_process_control.html), Scrum does not say how to do PBR, though suggests that the Team spend no more than 10% of their Sprint capacity on it. It usually happens “mid-Sprint.”

Note! Refinement of items is not done separately by the [Product Owner](product-owner.html) or a business analysis group—doing that would increase the [lean wastes](../principles/lean_thinking.html) of hand-off and information scatter. Rather, the Team does this work—and not a subset of the Team, but the whole Team, as Scrum rules prohibit sub-groups dedicated to particular domains such as analysis or testing.

## Product Backlog Refinement Overview

Product Backlog Refinement is often done in:

* Overall Product Backlog Refinement (shared amount all teams)
* Team-level Product Backlog Refinement
* Multi-team Product Backlog Refinement

## Overall Product Backlog Refinement

The LeSS rule raises the questions: How to decide which teams are likely to implement which items? And there are the scaling issues just examined: shared understanding, coordination, common work, aligned estimates, and balancing specialization and agility.

An overall PBR session addresses all of these. In brief, hold an overall PBR workshop with representatives before the individual team PBR sessions, to explore which teams might work on which items, and to increase learning and alignment. Attendees include the Product Owner, subject-matter experts, and either all members of all teams or a couple of representatives from each team. Representatives are usually preferred, to keep the meeting smaller and to not have everyone in yet another meeting, though the cost is information handoff and scatter.

Do the following:

* split big items
* do very lightweight item analysis for basic understanding
* estimate items
* identify strongly-related items that suggest shared work, common work, or coordination

## Team-level Product Backlog Refinement

When an item will clearly be done by one team and it won't be too strongly related to other items, then the Product Backlog Refinement is the same as in a one-team Scrum. The team does the refinement themselves, ideally together with users/customer/stakeholders and they inform the Product Owner related to changes (splitting, new estimates) in the Product Backlog.

## Multi-team Product Backlog Refinement

Multiteam PBR is when more than one team are (literally) in the same room at the same time doing PBR. Attendees include subject-matter experts, and either all members of the participating teams or a couple of representatives from each.

How is it different from overall PBR? Overall PBR includes participation from all teams, but multiteam PBR may involve as few as two teams. It is also more likely to include all members rather than representatives.

Do multiteam PBR to increase shared understanding and exploit coordination opportunities when a group of teams are working on a common family of items or strong-related items.

Multiteam PBR may be a complement or replacement to team PBR.

Ongoing Product Backlog Refinement (PBR) is needed within each Sprint to refine items to be ready for future Sprints. Key activities of PBR are (1) splitting big items, (2) detailing items until ready, and (3) estimating. In the spirit of [empirical process control](../principles/empirical_process_control.html), Scrum does not say how to do PBR, though suggests that the Team spend no more than 10% of their Sprint capacity on it. It usually happens “mid-Sprint.”
--->
継続的なプロダクトバックログリファインメント(PBR)は、将来のスプリントのプロダクトバックログアイテムを洗練するために、各スプリント内で必要とされている。
PBRの主なアクティビティは、(1)大きなプロダクトバックログアイテムを分割する。(2)準備ができるまでプロダクトバックログアイテムを詳細化する。(3)見積もりを行う。
[経験的プロセス制御](../principles/empirical_process_control.jp.html)の精神で、スクラムはPBRをどのように行うかは伝えてはいないにもかかわらず、チームは、スプリントの10%以下を費やすことを示唆している。それは通常"スプリントの中間"で発生します。 <!-- TODO mid-Sprint ってなんだ？ -->

<!---
Note! Refinement of items is not done separately by the [Product Owner](product-owner.html) or a business analysis group—doing that would increase the [lean wastes](../principles/lean_thinking.html) of hand-off and information scatter. Rather, the Team does this work—and not a subset of the Team, but the whole Team, as Scrum rules prohibit sub-groups dedicated to particular domains such as analysis or testing.
--->
注意！
プロダクトバックログアイテムの洗練は、[プロダクトオーナー](product-owner.jp.html)またはビジネスアナリストのグループとは別に行われていませんか - それを行なっていると、[手持ちのムダ](../principles/lean_thinking.jp.html)や情報の散乱を増加させるでしょう。
正しくは、スクラムのルールでは、分析やテストのような特定のドメインに専念するサブグループを禁止しています。チームのサブセットではなくチーム全体で行います。

Before you start your first Sprint, you need (1) a Product Backlog with some ready items, and (2) a Definition of Done. Scrum doesn’t name the activity for this, but we’ll use the term initial Product Backlog Refinement (initial PBR, IPBR), because it is similar to regular PBR each Sprint.

The ScrumMaster role is a new one and often not understood by teams and organizations who are adopting Scrum. A frequent response is to make the “leftover people” the ScrumMasters. They might be nice people but often lack the right skills, motivation, and Scrum knowledge to be effective ScrumMasters. They morph the role into something else which then becomes accepted within the organization as the way a ScrumMaster should be. After all, the ScrumMaster should know if they’re doing things correctly, right? Sometimes well-meaning ScrumMasters who are new to Scrum or not a good fit for the ScrumMaster role cause things to happen that are actually counter to Scrum and detrimental to Scrum adoption, thereby transforming them into anti-ScrumMasters.
